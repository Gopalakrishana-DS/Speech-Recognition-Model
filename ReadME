This project is a Python script that utilizes IPython widgets, threading, and external libraries such as PyAudio, Vosk, and recasepunc to create a real-time speech recognition and text transformation system. The core functionality includes:

Recording Audio: Users can initiate and stop audio recording by clicking on corresponding buttons in an interactive IPython environment.

Speech Recognition: The recorded audio is processed using the Vosk library, enabling real-time speech-to-text conversion.

Text Transformation: The transcribed text is further processed by applying text transformation using the recasepunc library. This likely includes tasks like case conversion and punctuation handling.

User Interface: The system offers user-friendly buttons for control and an output widget to display messages and the final transformed text.

In summary, this project allows users to record spoken audio, transcribe it into text, and apply text transformations in real-time, making it a useful tool for tasks like voice data collection and text preprocessing.
